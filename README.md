# VeilofDarkness

For the implementation for this website, the veil darkness is followed in general manner. First, the dataset for all Texas stops collected and cleaned by the Stanford Open Policing Project is used. Then the data without both the latitude and longitude attributes are left out from the dataset. A date time variable with the minute to which the stop occurred then is created from the date and stop time in the record. The metric for evaluating the biases is by looking at the ratio of driver races in stops before and after end of civil twilight (the sun is six degrees below the horizon). To get the end of civil twilight time for each day that had at least one stop. A popular python package PyEphem for nautical and astronomy was used. The PyEphem can take a date as an input and output the end of civil twilight time for a particular longitude and latitude combination. The average of latitudes and longitudes of all stops within each county. Then, this coordinate is used for all stops for that particular county. The total stops for each race before darkness is divided by the total stops all races before darkness, Rb. the total stops for each race after darkness is divided by the total stops all races after darkness, Ra.
